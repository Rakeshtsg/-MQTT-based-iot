# -MQTT-based-iot
This program uses the WiFi and MQTT libraries to connect to a WiFi network and an MQTT broker, respectively. The program first connects to the WiFi network using the provided credentials, and then connects to the MQTT broker. It also subscribes to a topic, which it uses to receive commands to control the IoT device. When a message is received on the subscribed topic, the program checks the contents of the message and controls the IoT device accordingly. For example, if the message is "on", the program might turn the device on, and if the message is "off", it might turn the device off.
